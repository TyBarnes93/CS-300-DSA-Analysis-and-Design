1. What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
   -The problem I was solving in the projects was making code in order to make the programs print out in the correct order. In project one it was a starting point to create project two.
   
2. How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
   - I approached the problems this semester by going off the provided zybooks or resources given and using external sources. 
   
3. How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
  - The same way as any problem I faced, by using external sources and that helped me open up other directions I could take to solve my roadblocks.

4. How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
   - By making any project I go into readable, maintainable, and adaptable as possible so I know when the day comes I'll be doing this for my company or multiple companies.
   
5. How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
   - My perspective on how I write programs hasn't changed. This area of my work has stayed around the same skill level while working on this project.
